# bwom
Opponent Modelling library for StarCraft: Brood War, using BWAPI

## Current state
The library is currently under developement. We are working on creating 9 independent neural networks for each matchup (PvP, PvZ, PvT, TvT, TvZ, TvP, ZvZ, ZvP, ZvT). Currently, there are implemented 3 neural networks for each race, but because of very high divergence in build orders and unit composition in every single matchup, 3 neural networks are not accurate enough.

Detailed description and usage with examples is provided in github wiki - https://github.com/Games-and-Simulations/bwom/wiki
